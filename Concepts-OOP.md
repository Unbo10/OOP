Being object-oriented means essentially it is *directed toward modeling objects*. An object is **a collection of data and behaviors associated to it**. That means objects can do certain actions (just like in real life!) and store some information.

An object-oriented approach is hence a strategy used to match data and behaviors in single elements (objects). Now, when implementing it into a software development project, it involves three main stages:

>| Stage | Description |
>| -------- | ------ | 
>| Analysis (OOA) | ***What** needs to be done? What are the **requirements** to do so?* Problem, system, task (I) -> Subtasks or processes required (O).|
>| Design (OOD) | ***How** will it be done? How will the requirements be turned into an **implementation specification**?* Requirements (I) -> A set of classes and interfaces (O). |
>| Programming (OOP) | ***Where** will the specification be implemented? What **programming language** should be used?* Set of classes and interfaces (I) -> A program with the implementation (O). |

Of course, this is a formal, organized and summarized way of viewing the approach, but in reality it doesn't follow this order (often it will be required to then go back while skipping something), it is way more flexible. Modern methods like iterative development -almost- finish smaller tasks and iterate through them once they work in another task.
